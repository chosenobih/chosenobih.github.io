## 2. Setting Up GitHub and Installing Prerequisites

### Step 1: Setting Up Windows Subsystem for linux (WSL). If you a macOS or ubuntu user, skip this step and continue with Step 2.
1. Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux:
   - Open PowerShell as an Administrator - Press **Win + S**, type PowerShell, right-click on it, and choose Run as Administrator.
   - Run the the command below to enable WSL and Virtual Machine Platform:
   - `wsl --install`
   - This command above will: Enable WSL, Install the necessary components (including the Virtual Machine Platform) and Download and install the default Linux distribution (typically Ubuntu).
   - Retart your computer when prompted
2. Install Ubuntu (if not installed during WSL setup):
   - After restarting, open Microsoft Store.
   - Search for Ubuntu.
   - Choose the version you prefer (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS) and click Get or Install.
   - Wait for the installation to complete.
3. Set Up Ubuntu:
   - Launch Ubuntu: Open the Start menu, type Ubuntu, and press Enter.
   - Set up your user credentials: The first time you launch Ubuntu, it will prompt you to create a Linux username and password.
   - Enter a username and password (this is independent of your Windows credentials).
   - Your Ubuntu system is now ready to use!
   - Once inside Ubuntu, update the system by running the command below
   - `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
   - Install some essential packages
   - `sudo apt install git python3 build-essential`

### Step 2: Set up Git and GitHub
   - **What is Git?** Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others.
   - **What is GitHub?** GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code repositories online.
   - **Key Git Commands:**
	**`git clone`**: Copies a remote repository to your local machine.
	**`git add`**: Stages changes for the next commit.
	**`git commit -m "message"`**: Saves changes to your local repository with a message.
	**`git push`**: Sends your changes to the remote GitHub repository.

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account if you donâ€™t have one.
2. Download and install **Git**:
   - **Windows**: Git should already be installed in your WSL from the previous step.
   - **macOS**: Install via Homebrew (`brew install git`) or download from [Git for macOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
   - **Ubuntu**: Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`.
3. Configure Git with your GitHub credentials:
   - `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
   - `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`

### Step 3: Install Ruby, Bundle and VC Code
1. Install **Ruby**:
   - **macOS**: Install via Homebrew (`brew install ruby`).
   - **Ubuntu/Windows_WSL**: Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ruby-full`.
2. Install **VC Code** (code/text editor):
   - Download from [VS Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), install, open the app and click on terminal.
   - For Windows WSL users, within the VS Code terminal, select Ubuntu WSL as the terminal choice
3. Install **Bundle** - the Ruby dependency manager by running.
   `sudo gem install bundler`
   
### Additional step for Windows WSL users
   - **Accessing Windows Files from WSL**
   - In WSL, your Windows file system is mounted under `/mnt` directory. Each drive (e.g. C:, D:) is mounted as a subdirectory under `/mnt`.
   - C Drive: `/mnt/c`
   - D Drive: `mnt/d`
   - Other drives: `/mnt/e`, `/mnt/f`, etc
   - **Steps to navigate to a folder (Windows WSL users only)**
   - Within your VS Code WSL terminal
   - Type in the command below to change directory to your C drive
   - `cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Documents`

## 3. Cloning the Academic Pages GitHub Repository

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Visit this link in a new tab:
   - `https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io.git`

3. Fork the repo (Remember to rename it to a name you desire - this name will be in your website link)
4. Clone the repository you just forked to your local machine:
   - Open your VS code and click on terminal. Run the command below:
   - `git clone repo https link`
5. Navigate into the repository:
   - `cd your-username.github.io`
6. Open the repo folder in your VC Code

## 4. Editing pages and content

### Step 1: Customize `_config.yml`
1. Open the `_config.yml` file and edit your personal details, such as:
   - **Name**
   - **Email**
   - **Social media links**
2. Run the site locally to test:
   - `bundle install`  to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
   - `sudo bundle exec jekyll serve`

3. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to preview the site.

## 5. Adding more Content: Publications, CV, and Blog Posts

### To be demonstrated in class

## 6. Deploying the Website on GitHub Pages

1. Commit your changes:
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "Initial setup of the academic website"`
   - `git push origin main`

2. Go to the repository settings on GitHub, under Pages section, Build and deployment, set the source to the main branch. 
3. Wait for a few minutes and access your live site at `https://your-username.github.io`.

## 7. Customizing Further: Adding Plugins and Features

1. Install plugins such as **Google Analytics** or **social sharing buttons**:
   - Add the plugin to your `Gemfile` and `_config.yml`.
   - Run `bundle install` to install the plugins.

## 8. Q&A and Troubleshooting
- Common issues: Missing dependencies, configuration errors, and troubleshooting theme display problems.
- Open Q&A session to address participant questions.
