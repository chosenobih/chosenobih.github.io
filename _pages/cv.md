CHOSEN OBIH
Ph.D. student
      School of Plant Sciences
University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ

### INTERESTS
Broadly, I’m interested in the application of computational and data science skills to solve problems in sustainable agriculture. My current research focuses on using large-scale comparative-omics approaches (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, epitranscriptomics, etc.) to better understand plants' (crop grasses) responses to abiotic stress, and identify the mechanisms which confer abiotic stress tolerance to some varieties.  In addition, I am also passionate about bridging the gap between science and society through effective science communication.

### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
2023-Present	University of Arizona
PhD student in the Melandri lab. Currently working on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of biochemical traits (primary metabolites, oxidative stress-related enzyme activities and markers) on large diversity panels of rice and durum wheat and fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified by GWAS using pan-genome analysis. In addition, I design, execute and manage abiotic stress experiments in the greenhouse and field.

2021-2023	University of Arizona
PhD student in Lyons lab. Worked on the development of high-throughput computational pipelines for processing RNASeq data for annotating post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs).
    • Developed HAMRLNC: HAMRLNC is a comprehensive pipeline for high-throughput analysis of modified ribonucleotides and long non-coding ribonucleic acids from RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data.
    • Developed PAMLINC: PAMLINC is a scalable and distributed pipeline for parallel annotation of modified ribonucleotides and long intergenic non-coding ribonucleic acids.
    • Benchmarking RNASeq analysis programs: Evaluated several aspects of RNASeq reads aligners for use in RNA modifications and long non-coding RNAs annotation pipeline.

2020-2021	DNA Learning Center Nigeria
Science instructor: I taught courses and labs on DNA science, genome science, DNA barcoding and metabarcoding to high school students, college students and early career researchers. I also led capacity-building workshops for early-career researchers and professors.

2014-2021	Godfrey Okoye University, Enugu, Nigeria
    • Graduate teaching/research assistant: I taught and assisted professors in their classes; carried out independent research; and supported students in understanding course modules/lectures. I analyzed the sequence data generated from a World Bank Step-B project on DNA Barcoding of CITEs listed organisms in Nigeria and species of economic importance.
    • Biotechnology laboratory coordinator: I coordinated lab activities, and helped design and implement laboratory standard practices for undergraduate, and graduate students and visiting researchers.
    • Undergraduate research assistant: I Worked on DNA barcoding of economic species of South-eastern Nigeria project led by Prof. George Nkem Ude. Some of the projects that I worked on include DNA barcoding of Medicinal Plants, DNA barcoding of Yam species found in Southeastern Nigeria and DNA barcoding of Freshwater Fish Species in Southeastern Nigeria. I assisted with sample collection, DNA extraction, PCR amplification and analysis of generated DNA sequence data.

2015-2018	South Saharan Social Development Organization Enugu, Nigeria
Radio school science teacher: I developed a middle school basic science curriculum to suit the radio school format, and I taught basic science to middle school students at Godfrey Okoye University Secondary School. Lessons that I helped create are still being aired on radio stations across Nigeria.

2015-2016	Padre Pio Secondary School Ogoli Ugboju Benue, Nigeria
Science teacher - National Youth Service Corp (NYSC): I taught biology and basic science to middle and high school students, and I coordinated the science club and sports club of the school.
